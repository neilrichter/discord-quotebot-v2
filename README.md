# Discord Quotebot v2

## Installation :

Run `npm install` to install the dependendies, rename `config.js.dist` to `config.js` and insert your bot token (or your own token) in the quotes.

If you want to use your bot as a self-bot, you can find your token in the Discord client by opening the Dev Tools with `⌘ + ⌥ + I` on Mac keyboards or `Ctrl + Shift + I` on other keyboards.

## Running the bot :

To run the bot, run `npm run bot` or `node index.js`. Stop it with `Ctrl + C`.
